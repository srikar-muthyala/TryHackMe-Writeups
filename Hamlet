Welcome to Hamlet! 

This is a fairly straightforward CTF-like room in which you will play with an uncommon web application used in linguistic research. You will also learn a little bit about Docker. While there are CTF elements, there are quite a few "real" problems in here. Feel free to explore!
There's a total of six flags. You don't necessarily have to find them in order. (Flags: THM{#_flag})
Please note that the machine takes a while to boot fully, and some services will only become available after a few minutes.

Three flags have been found so far, more will be added soon.

Starting off by enumerating the machine with nmap scan, 
nmap -sV -sC -oN nmap_scan -p- 10.10.225.34


While the previous scan was taking too long, I did another basic scan without -p- parameter showing a few open ports:

21/tcp    open   ftp        vsftpd 3.0.3
22/tcp    open   ssh        OpenSSH 7.6p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.5 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
80/tcp    open   http       lighttpd 1.4.45
8000/tcp  open   http       Apache httpd 2.4.48 ((Debian))
8080/tcp  open   http-proxy

Anonymous login was enabled on FTP,

This shows more open ports which were not detected by nmap.

Browsing to port 80, we can see Micheal's alternate name as 'ghost'. And it says that he is obsessed with Hamlet and the vocabulary used by Shakespeare. 
Directory enumeration reveals robots.txt, which contains flag-1.

Webpage on port 8080 is a login page. and the title says "WebAnno - Log in"
Using cewl to generate wordlist from the version of hamlet their org is using, with the password policy we found earlier,

cewl -m 12 -w wordlist.txt --lowercase http://10.10.225.34/hamlet.txt

We are presented with 75 words,

wc -l wordlist.txt 
75 wordlist.txt

Brute forcing with Burp Suite gets us the access.

We can change passwords for other users with ghost user.

gaining access to ophelia accnt provides us with a password not associated with WebAnno, SSH did not work. Tried FTP and bingo!
We get access to flag3.


Moving up a directory in FTP session, we see 
drwxr-xr-x    2 1002     1002         4096 Sep 15 14:44 gravediggers
